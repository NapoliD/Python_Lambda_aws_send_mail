Click on the "Verify a New Email Address" button and verify the email address you want to use for sending emails
Go to the "SMTP Settings" section and create an IAM user with SMTP credentials
Note down the SMTP credentials (SMTP username and password) for later use in your Python code
Install Boto3 library:

In your local development environment, install the Boto3 library using pip: pip install boto3
Write Python code for sending emails:

Import the Boto3 library: import boto3
Create an SES client object: client = boto3.client('ses',region_name='your-region-name')
